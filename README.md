# SENG1005FinalProject — 3Games

Final Project for Fall 2025 SENG 1005 at East Carolina University.

This project was originally created as a group assignment. It was initially privatized by another group member, but I decided to bring it back and preserve it here because I’m genuinely proud of how it turned out.

## What is 3Games?
**3Games** is, as suggested by its title, a GUI application that utilizes both Python and Tkinter to allow the user to play one of three games:
- **Blackjack**
- **Wordle**
- **Rock Paper Scissors**

Each game opens in its own window, which comes with homemade assets and a familiar-sounding sound library!
